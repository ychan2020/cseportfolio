												Detailed information regarding the Codes of Ethics and Professional Conduct was supplied at the start of this module. The Association of Computing Machinery (ACM) has produced several case studies that would be discussed. The "Reasoning Quiz" used a few examples to assess the comprehension of inductive and deductive reasoning.<br>
												Understanding the British Computer Society's (BCS) Code of Conduct, which outlines the qualities of IT professionals, demonstrates the seriousness with which the development of a morally upright and responsible computer industry is taken. Using examples, describe the effects of wrongdoing and its consequences.<br>
												I should constantly keep ethics and conduct in mind as an IT professional. According to the regulations and requirements for daily jobs. Despite appearing to be common sense, the Q Industries case demonstrated how intricate the truth is. On the one side, they may strive to make the public aware of the ethical dilemma. On the other hand, it is possible that their behaviour is against the policy of the company. These disputes may have a snowball effect on entire sectors. The white hat hackers and how to define "good" were also covered in the essay "Ethics vs Morality" (John, 2018). That makes me think about the work I do on a daily basis since there are a lot of grey areas that could be difficult to categorise as right or wrong.<br>

												Introduce the connection between the research proposal, the literature review, and the research questions in Unit 2. Lara Hammock's (2018) Step-by-Step Guide will assist in starting our examination and subsequent module with an organised procedure. Continue planning and investigation in this area and discover a potential solution to include in the research proposal.<br>
												The Dark UX Patterns case may have also broken Federal Trade Commission (FTC) rules, according to my peer response. Even though our team frequently modifies a nice user interface (UI) for a better user experience (UX). We could overlook the UI in the payment part that is necessary to obtain the customer's consent and steer clear of any information that would block, reduce, conflict with, or otherwise impair the capacity of the customer. I would discuss it with my team member so we can provide our users access to a fair-trade setting. I have gained more knowledge about Amazon Web Services (AWS) user agreements from the Malware Disruption case. As a service provider, it must control how customers use their product and work to prevent misuse.<br>

											<summary><b>Unit 3</b></summary>
											<p>Exploratory investigation and conclusive research were covered in detail in Unit 3. To validate my conclusions and help me decide on a plan of action, I tended to use the conclusive research design (BRM, n.d.). Since secondary research must be used instead of primary research, data is taken from primary research that has already been published or published case studies. In this situation, finding the right information could be challenging and it could also help me to become a better researcher.<br>
												In the summary post, the situation of the American Army Paul Scharre explains 'doing what is legal' and 'doing what is right' are not necessarily the same (Paul, 2018). This kind of reflection on decision-making is beneficial when deciding between moral and legal considerations.<br>

												'Implementing Cyber Security tools and/or techniques in detecting medical misinformation on a social media platform of Twitter' is the topic I picked for my literature review. Most of the medical material on social media in recent years has been about the information on COVID-19 (Sotto & Viviani, 2022). The fight against disinformation is crucial given the quick and widespread diffusion of information on social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube.<br>
												After doing some investigation, I discovered that several studies have suggested utilising machine learning algorithms to identify false news predictions (Marriboyina et al, 2021). Despite it is not a cyber security tool, it is a reliable method to use as a stage in the process of identifying medical misinformation.<br>

												Unit 5 discussed the design of interviews and surveys for the primary research in some detail. To determine the level of pleasure in various scenarios, it is suggested to choose the appropriate questions and interviewee. A balanced mix of both closed and open-ended questions should be included in the survey. The duration and incentives of the surveys will have an influence on the response rates. The case study is an illustration of how surveys were misused on Facebook in 2018, resulting in data leaks affecting tens of millions of users (Nicholas, 2018). I developed a survey to find out how satisfied people were with my project's work in the past, this study gave me ideas for how to garner more replies and reliable data going forward.<br>

												In-depth knowledge about asking the proper questions and how to avoid asking leading or pushy questions is provided in the lecture on questionnaire design (QuestionPro, 2021). Studying the Growing Science (2022) paper revealed that using an expanded Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) can make the research model simpler to analyse (Hu et al., 2018). That showed me how to develop a questionnaire in a professional manner with these models and designs.<br>

												According to my literature review, the Birdwatch programme allows Twitter users to rate and make corrections to tweets. Twitter aims to mould them in an open environment (Twitter, 2021), and looks to be delegating additional power over policing incorrect user data (Taylor, 2022).  Finding the gap between artificial intelligence, machine learning, and the Birdwatch. This could be an interesting area for me to offer a solution that should match Twitter's goals and values.<br>
												The conflict of interest between the sponsor and the researcher was demonstrated in the case study of Abi. Even if it seems like there are certain ways to create win-win circumstances, doing so might have serious ethical issues and a deep influence on the public.<br>

												There is a chance to exercise my statistical analysis abilities starting from this unit. I utilised MS Excel to compute the numbers on summary measures and inference using formulae and tools. Understanding how to evaluate and analyse the data by outlining the results is also crucial. A statistical technique known as hypothesis testing is used to examine the survey findings and create results that are relevant to our research.<br>
												In my response to Abi's case, I discovered other negative effects of research misconduct, including publication bias and result reporting bias, which have cost billions of dollars in the past (Chan et al., 2014). Regardless of whether there is an intention, we should exercise caution and prevent bias when working on research that will be published.<br>
												In the research proposal outline, I begin to concentrate on the cybersecurity tool blockchain for identifying medical misinformation. There are not many studies on this particular topic, and most of it is quite recent, so it should be worth investigating and developing.<br>

											<p>The statistical analysis skills exercise for this subject includes charts and analysis. It is a graphical data visualisation representation that offers instant understanding and data comparison. I would utilise charts and tables since they are recommended for the research proposal presentation to build stronger support for my methodology.<br>
												In the summary post of Abi's case, I discovered a database for retractions that stored records of retractions articles that made by non-profit organisations (Retraction Database, 2023). Our study must take care not to violate any of these factors that might cause it to be withdrawn.<br>

												The entire research proposal presentation needed presentation slides, a transcript, and a recording in addition to the proposal's content. Although I had already drafted the resolution, it would not be easy to explain. To describe using simple-reading slides, I attempt to use as many visuals as I can. However, I discovered that there were few publicly available research data that were pertinent to my theory. Therefore, I was unable to apply statistical methods for a thorough examination. The data collection of my proposed methodology must produce after the simulation is ready. The lesson learned is the idea is too novel and there is not enough evidence to back it, I must prepare their own data in the earlier state.<br>
