								<p><h3>Unit 1</h3></p>
								<ul>
									<p>
										The first learning discussion case study (Glisson, 2015) shows how could cyber threats attack medical devices. With the series of attacks, brute force attacks and denial of service attacks (DoS), the WiFi security protocols vulnerability could be exploited. It had reflected that the old version of the technology could be dangerous while no regular update. I had reviewed the weak password and the complexity rules set up before, changing with the stronger passwords with more combinations. Moreover, I did some research about BackTrack 5, which is the old version of Kali Linux since 2013 (Backtrack, 2013).<br>
										From the lecture cast, gained some knowledge of network history and definitions and the theory of security.<br><br>

								<p><h3>Unit 2</h3></p>
								<ul>
									<p>
										After the team assignment launched, I created a new Signal group and contact every member to join the group. Although there are only 3 members joining, we started to work on seminar 1 preparation. Each of us provided the DREAD rating table for the presentation, it is a great tool for quantifying the cyber risk, we might consider using it again.<br>
										From the peer response, I did research on the vulnerability of WPA2 and WPA3 including Key Reinstallation Attacks (KRACK) and Dragonblood attacks (Mathy & Eyal, 2019). That surprised me about the weakness in the security of WiFi. I soon had reviewed the WiFi router which I set up, upgraded firmware and changed the security to WPA3 instead of WPA2. In addition, I did research on Zero Trust (ZT) technology which could consider for the next business plan of my work.<br><br>

									</p>
								</ul>
								<p><h3>Unit 3</h3></p>
								<ul>
									<p>
										From the initial post feedback, the access control mentioned by Beran (2021), it could be argued that grant access should be based on the principle of least privilege (PoLP) security concept (Cyberark, 2021). In my experience, it could be a time-consuming part to design those access from an IT point of view. It would be better to involve the business user to discuss their need and let them test them. In addition, adopting Privileged password management (PPM) which generate the password for temporary privileged access could be a solution to control the super admin right.<br>
										For the team activity, we made use of the standard network tools to scan the basic information for our target site. Discuss our findings and understand the variety of the result, decide what we would present in the seminar. Understand that team members might not be able to join every seminar, at this point, I suggested the rotation of the presenter in our team.<br>
										The lecture cast provided a refreshment on the Network Fundamentals with the OSI model.<br><br>

								</ul>
								<p><h3>Unit 4</h3></p>
								<ul>
									<p>
										Learning discussion 2 requires us to explain the standard network tools findings. Normally I used those tools for network testing or troubleshooting only, however, we used them to analyse a website which requires understanding the mechanism behind those tools and pointing out the important information that might be missed. In addition, after researching the registered information of the whois command, found that information could be registered to the domain name wholesaler company (Enom, N.D.).<br>
										For seminar 2 preparation, I did research and compare it with TCP/IP and ISO/OSI, 7 layers are the common term which explained by the network team for different level issues during my work, however, practically we used TCP/IP.<br><br>

								<p><h3>Unit 5</h3></p>
								<ul>
									<p>
										During this week, I installed the Kali Linux on the virtual machine for evaluation, it comes with a lot of powerful tools, it would require researching the guide and command sample on how to use those.<br>
										In the peer response of learning discussion 2, found that Nmap is a slim but powerful tool to detect port and software versions. The version could be detected by common services associated ports and response from the port to gather data. For security concerns, it could be better to set the customize or by using Network Address Port Translation (NAPT) to redirect a different port number to the internal service (Parziale et al, 2006).<br>
										Moreover, found the target site has been configured Sender Policy Framework (SPF) with text strings recorded in the Domain Name System (DNS) (Parziale et al, 2006). The SPF record is a basic way to prevent domain spoofing (Wong & Schlitt, 2006) which I usually set for the mail server before.<br><br>

									</p>
								</ul>
								<p><h3>Unit 6</h3></p>
								<ul>
									<p>
										In the summary post, I could finally explain why the traceroute result could be empty for Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP). The exploitability of ICMP echo requests could be a cyber threat that should be filtered. There are easy and effective to block those requests now a day such as a web application firewall (WAF).<br>
										During my penetration test with Kali Linux, WAF could block quite a lot of attacks, it had blocked my IP addresses more than 20 times. Even I tried to use the proxy server, the false results were returned during the test. I may try to think of other ways for a successful and accurate penetration result.<br>
										For the team activity evaluation exercise, Geer (2015) blog post provide 8 penetration tools to compare which provided a useful suggestion for choosing the tool. For all the tools which I have already installed and tested in Kali Linux, I have provided the initial rating table and demonstrated each tool to my team member. Moreover, I was assigned to write the security vulnerabilities and review the recommendation for the Team Project Design Document. Due to the page and word limit, I decide to use the DREAD table to combine vulnerabilities and recommendations. In addition, categorize and group the items to have a clear and summarized presentation.<br><br>

								<p><h3>Unit 7</h3></p>
								<ul>
									<p>
										In the Scanning Exercise sharing in Wiki, although I was the first one who shared results, other participants findings are mostly the same. That could confirm I was on the right track. I continue to run penetration tests in Kali Linux with lower levels and try to add some modules to bypass the WAF detection (Portswigger, 2017).<br>
										For the team e-Portfolio activity, we have discussed the pros and cons of the penetration test tools. In addition, I have shared the findings and reported them to my member for reference. On the other hand, we seem to have a high mark in the design document, but not all the members have the same mark which might cause by the peer review. The team started to become disharmony after this review result. In general, I think the percentage of the reviewed marks should be transparent to the members.<br><br>

								<p><h3>Unit 8</h3></p>
								<ul>
									<p>
										In the learning discussion 3 GDPR case study and the seminar 4 preparation, discussed the definition of the role and responsibility of data controllers and processors. As well as the decision of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) on the case with the highlight with the former employee. For better understanding, I had reviewed my Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Clauses in Commercial Contracts to understand how it could control the risk.<br>
										For the penetration test on the target site in Kali Linux, I wonder the result could be more accurate if the system can be scanned locally with the assumed version of the SugarCRM. I found the source code from Github (Matthew, 2018) and downloaded the installation guide for the setup preparation.<br><br>

								<p><h3>Unit 9</h3></p>
								<ul>
									<p>
										The lecture cast introduced another powerful tool for forensics, Caine (N.D.) which is similar to Kali Linux. I did some study on that and found how critical to imaging or cloning from the source data to protect the original data source. That is the reason for us to keep multiple copies of the backup of the system as well as the log retention.<br>
										In the learning discussion 3, found that it is common that the unsuccessful opt-out request was due to human error which those organization occurred. For the response, I chose the case which could be related to PCI Security Standards (2020) or HIPAA (2020). The Virgin Media Ireland website provided online purchasing that accepts credit cards payment which is easy to find out it has compliant with Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS).<br><br>

								<p><h3>Unit 10</h3></p>
								<ul>
									<p>
										In seminar 5 preparation on Sony case, research on the required reaction for the data breach and the importance of the timely report. Even the game giant company could be missed on the cyber threat and those requirements.<br>
										This week, I managed to set up the SugarCRM in my test environment and started to perform scans locally to compare with the target site result. Moreover, this is a best practice to have internal testing which could simulate the attack by a malicious insider (Imperva, N.D.)<br>
										In the learning discussion 3 summary, regarding the data encoded as part of security precautions (Beran, 2022). Reminded me of the personal information encryption or partially masked which could mitigate the inappropriate behaviour from employees. In addition, inspired me to check on the SugarCRM database if the user password had been encrypted.<br>
										For the team activity, we assigned penetration test tools for each member to run the test on the target website. Based on my experience I had suggested they keep refreshing the target site to prevent the WAF reCAPTCHA challenge failed and blocking the IP address.<br><br>

								<p><h3>Unit 11</h3></p>
								<ul>
									<p>
										After the scan on SugarCRM in my test environment, found that by providing admin access, some tools could inject requests to the web app. Also, I was able to test on the command if it works, such as brute force attack by hydra and the exploit test which required user account by MSF (Exploit DB, 2016). This had validated the accuracy of the penetration test result.<br>
										For the team activity, we had shared the scan result with provided the expected findings. I was assigned for the discussion of vulnerabilities part in the Executive Summary to explain the details for the finding and provide recommendations. I suggested dividing the suggestion into short, medium, and long term for better presentation structure. In addition, presented to the team member about my findings on the debate topic.<br><br>

								<p><h3>Unit 12</h3></p>
								<ul>
									<p>
										In the seminar 6 debate preparation, I did research on the three different topics and the information provided in the survey (Ding, 2016). Content centric networking (CCN) and Peer-to-peer overlay-based networking are mature technologies that have been implemented on many existing tools. Comparatively, MobilityFirst is a newer technology which having lack of use case. The target device of MobilityFirst is movable devices like vehicles that reminded me of a video game, Watchdog, having a lot of auto-piloted drones and vehicles could be a visualize world to present.<br>
										In the final e-Portfolio Submission, the summary of refection is useful for us to review the whole subject, evaluate what we have learnt and how these could use to improve our skills. Just like the IT Service Management system I used in my workplace.<br>
										Finally, I would like to thank our tutor Mr Necatall, as well as all the work by the team members and other participants. I am pleased to be working with the team on this project.<br><br>

								<p><h3>Reflection Summary</h3></p>
								<ul>
									<p>
										This module Network and Information Security Management covered the theory knowledge and practical usage about cybersecurity. Theory knowledge includes network evolution, legal and social, mitigation of cyber threats. Practical usage includes vulnerability, penetration tests and collaboration.<br><br>
										
										<strong>Network Evolution</strong><br>
										The network is the fundamental and critical part of cyber security, the aim to build a safe and reliable network environment, we must understand the architecture and prevent the weakness.<br>
										The lecture casts describe the network history and definitions since 1943 for UK allied forces war effort, the TCP/IP and ISO/OSI model using nowadays and the future trends of network technology. Besides the improvement of speed and usage, the architecture in the future is more focused on how the network package could support mobility and confidentiality. The network package could contain more information to enhance the data package including supporting seamless connection and having dynamic identification.<br>
										By reading the technical articles from IEEE and Wi-Fi Alliance, understanding the need to develop new network architecture to support the growth of devices together with the Internet of Things (IoT) is the future trend. The cyber threat could be a huge impact and quickly spread in the future, there is an urgency for us to implement a secure network architecture and be ready to defend against those new threads.<br><br>

										<strong>Legal and Social issues</strong><br>
										The case studies in this module are mainly related to General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), PCI Security Standards and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).<br>
										According to the case studies, mentioned that the impact of the data disclosure in the organization to the public society, the responsible of the organization and how they should react to minimize the impact with escalation action, stop service and Business Continuity Plan. During the discussion learnt the definition of the role and responsibility of data controllers and processors. As well as the decision of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) on the case with the highlight with the former employee. Most of the case studies appeared that it is common that the unsuccessful opt-out request was due to human error in which those organizations occurred.<br>
										For better understanding, I had reviewed my Confidentiality and Non-Disclosure Clauses in Commercial Contracts to understand how it could control the risk. For the study of other rules, I chose the case which could be related to PCI Security Standards or HIPAA for the peer response.<br><br>

										<strong>Mitigation</strong><br>
										The Architecture of the system is the fundamental defence from the cyber threat. By research in Zero Trust Network and Microservice Architecture (Chris, 2021), is the new thread of development model providing isolated, small, and autonomous services network to mitigate the impact. For the software development, the project should break down into small parts and be required to shift to Zero Trust architecture.<br>
										Using up-to-date software and regular patching is the best practice nowadays, End of Life software could not be able to prevent zero-day attacks. By updating the software agilely, I start to use containers and DevOps tools to update software and release more frequently. Moreover, having a staging environment and quick rollback to mitigate the new threat, system stability should not be an excuse to prevent web and application servers from updating regularly to mitigate the impact of vulnerabilities.<br>
										The human factor is a difficult part to control and mitigate, organization contracts, policy and education could reduce the risk. On the other hand, we could adopt technology to prevent abusive behaviour as well. The case studies appeared that the significance to have personal information encryption or partially masked which could mitigate the inappropriate behaviour from employees. Moreover, the grant access process could be based on the principle of least privilege (PoLP) security concept (Cyberark, 2021) to limit employees with the least privilege (CISA, 2013).<br><br>

										<strong>Vulnerability</strong><br>
										During the module, I did research on the vulnerability in different areas including WiFi, operating system, database, and application. The high-risk vulnerability reported along with the proof of concept (POC) showed how the vulnerability could be exploited and impacted the system.<br>
										In our executive summary, focusing to discuss the high Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) score vulnerabilities in SugarCRM, such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Though the target site implemented WAF, some of the malicious scripts can execute. These vulnerabilities could use attribute cookies or validate inputs or special characters filter to mitigate, however, there is still have chance to exploit if the filter library is not up to date. It showed the significance of the access right configuration and encryption of the data in the database setup. By checking the SugarCRM database, the user account password is being encrypted. Moreover, the password could add salt encryption to have stronger protection of the hash string (Brian, 2014).<br><br>

										<strong>Penetration Tests</strong><br>
										By examining the target site, give us a testing platform to perform case practice on penetration tests. There are sufficient recommendations and methods provided in the suggested articles.<br>
										During my penetration test with Kali Linux, WAF blocked my IP addresses more than 20 times. Even I tried to use the proxy server and WAF bypass module, the false results were returned. I got the confident result until I set up the same version testing environment with the source code from Github (Matthew, 2018). It proved that the result could be more accurate if the system can be scanned locally, having internal testing which could simulate the attack by a malicious insider (Imperva, N.D.). It reflects the urgency when the zero-day vulnerability disclosed since the attacker are well tested on that impacted system. Nessus could be one of the quickest software to detect the vulnerability in the internal network by installing the new plugin, such as the Apache Log4j vulnerability that happened last year (Tenable, 2022).<br><br>

										<strong>Collaboration</strong><br>
										I am fortunate to be a part of this group that gives many contributions and has the same expectation to provide quality work. Tasks have been divided and assigned properly, having a timely output and all tasks could be finished on time. Nevertheless, the team was disharmony for a short period after the peer review result, it might be caused by the untransparent of the review result.<br>
										During our discussion, we do not hesitate to share suggestions and knowledge. To learn from each other, I have demonstrated each tool that I tested in Kali Linux to my team member and suggested a way to prevent blocking the IP address when the WAF reCAPTCHA challenge failed with my working experience.<br>
										Besides the group member, we have the charge to learn from participating in the learning discussion peer response, which inspected me to research in deep and critical thinking in the topics.<br><br>
