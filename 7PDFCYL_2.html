									<p><h3>Seminar 1</h3></p>
									<p>Choose one of the cybercrimes in the CPS (Cyber Physical Systems) guidance.</p>
									<p>The case analysis should provide:
										some description and explanation of the crime;
										identify its unique characteristics;
										evaluate the extent of which this cybercrime is different than its off-line version (if it lacks a direct comparison, assess whether this is a complete new offence or whether there could be any analogies with an even remotely similar offline offence);
										identify and assess issues concerning laws (you can focus on one jurisdiction or provide an international overview);
										identify and assess issues concerning burden of proof, standards of proof and admissibility.
									<p><a href="doc/7PDFCYL/Seminar1Preparation.pptx">Seminar 1 Preparation</a></p>
									<p></p>
									<p><h3>Seminar 2</h3></p>
									<p>Part 1
										Read Bryant and Kennedy (2014): Consider how the investigative process has changed, and what has been the connection between law and policing (focusing on evidence)?
										Drawing upon the above two readings, reflect the extent of which the above arguments are reflected in your own home country?</p>
									<p>Part 2
										Read Summers (2012), Badiya at al (2020), and Holt (2015); carry out wider internet research if need to. Then answer the question:
										What are some of the problems law enforcement investigators (you can focus on the country of your choosing, or several countries) face when collecting digital evidence from a crime scene?</p>	
									<p>Part 3
										Read Sunde and Dror (2019): and answer the following question:
										What are the issues raised in the article, and how these might affect further the validity and collection of evidence?</p>
									<p><a href="doc/7PDFCYL/Seminar2Preparation.docx">Seminar 2 Preparation</a></p>
									<p></p>
									<p><h3>Seminar 3</h3></p>
									<p>Activity 1
										This task will help you to start thinking about some of the issues which you will have to include in your forthcoming presentation. This week's reading includes several blogs related to cybercrime. Choose one or carry out your own research applicable to your country. Identify a blog entry which you find most interesting and has to do with victim of cybercrime (any type) and/or harm caused/suffered from such crimes. Apply your knowledge acquired so far and carry out wider research if need to.
										Write a brief review on it (max 500 words) and be prepared to share your finding in this week's seminar. The review can include the following pointers and other key issues you have found:
										The concern raised in the blog.
										Who is the victim? What is the harm?
										Your critical evaluation of the situation described with reference to any practical issues discussed on the module so far.</p>
										<p>Activity 2
										Skim through the 2019 report by the American Internet Crime Complain Centre; you might want to check whether a newer report has been issued here. Then, move to p.17 (on the 2019 report) and see whether you can identify your country of origin (alternatively, you can choose your country of residence, or even a country of residence of relatives of friends).
										Next, scroll down to the statistics related to the USA. Carry out some research and try breaking down as much as you can the number of victims identified in your chosen country into types and number of specific offences (note that accessible data might be limited). Be prepared to share your findings and conclusions in this week's seminar.

									<p></p>
									<p><h3>Seminar 4</h3></p>
									<p>Read Chapter 9 of Holt et al (2018) and answer the following questions (be prepared to share your findings in this week's seminar:</p>
										<p>Pick two theories discussed in the chapter. Briefly summarise these and identify weaknesses and strengths in explaining cybercrime.
										Carry out an internet search and identify a news event involving cybercrime (in any country). Reflect on which theory you might use to make sense of the individual(s)'s behaviour.
										Do we need cybercrime-specific theories or are traditional criminological theories adequate? By drawing upon Holt et al. try constructing a theory which might help us making sense of cyberspace deviance.</p>

									<p></p>
									<p><h3>Seminar 5</h3></p>
									<p>Activity 1
										In 2009, the first prison sentence was given for posting messages on Facebook for an offence under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. Keeley Houghton carried out a campaign of harassment against her victim for several years. She posted a murder threat on her victim's Facebook page, which resulted in the prosecution for harassment.
										Read Carter's (2009) report of the case 'Teenage girl is first to be jailed for bullying on Facebook'
										Answer these questions and be prepared to share your thoughts in this week's seminar:
										Consider the effectiveness of this measure.
										How the dealing of this case would have been different if Keeley Houghton were not a British citizen, she was not living in the UK during the time she carried out the harassment, but her victim was a British citizen living in the UK?</p>
										<p>Activity 2
										Search for a cybercrime case that adversely impacted a state's territorial sovereignty (could be your home country or any other country). Write a brief report on the following, and be prepared to share this with in the seminar:
										What happened in the case?
										Why you believe that the state's territorial sovereignty was violated?
										Reflect on the following: In what ways can cybercrime interfere with territorial sovereignty? And does this matter? How? Why?</p>
									<p><a href="doc/7PDFCYL/Seminar5preparation.pptx">Seminar 5 Preparation</a></p>
									<p></p>
									<p><h3>Seminar 6</h3></p>
									<p>Activity 1
										Read Karie et al. (2019) and answer these questions:
										What is according to the authors the importance of ISO/IEC 27043:2015 guidance for digital investigation?
										What is the authors' recommendation as to digital forensic standard of reporting?
										What key factors do the authors identify to further improve reporting?</p>
										<p>Activity 2
										Go back to the case study you used in MMA2.
										Read the brief for EoAM; map out your report based on the brief.
										Record in your e-Portfolio an initial bibliographical list that you have identified in the above preliminary internet research.
