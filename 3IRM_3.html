										This module Information Risk Management covered the theory knowledge and practical usage of risk management. Theory knowledge includes implementation methodologies, business continuity (BC) and disaster recovery (DR) plans. Practical usage includes Risk assessment frameworks, approaches, methodology and collaboration.<br><br>

										<b>Implementation methodologies</b><br>
										The most common implementation methodologies used in business are SDLC, Agile and DevOps now a day. Learnt the comparison and possibility of using the hybrid-work model for the organizations, the uses of these methodologies depended on the organization's needs and culture.<br>
										For the last 2 years, my work process requires the use of components of Agile and DevOps. Instead of transforming the implementation methodologies, large organizations tend to take the benefit of the new methodologies and keep some benefits of the SDLC, like the documentation and approval processes.<br><br>

										<b>Business continuity (BC) and disaster recovery (DR) plans</b><br>
										Due to the large disasters that happened that have occurred in recent years, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. BC and DR solutions must now consider a longer-term solution. Nevertheless, with the help of virtual machines, containers, and even cloud solutions, location or region resilience becomes quick and simple. (Azure, 2022).<br>
										Trends in remote work have the potential to ease the limitations of physical working locations. Whereas it may raise the difficulty of the security risk, it could be addressed by employee policies and activity monitoring.<br><br>

										<b>Risk assessment Approaches</b><br>
										In the collaborative learning discussion, we have elaborated on the usage of approaches. The quantitative approach concentrates on objective measurements by using statistical or historical data based on mathematical conceptions, the quantitative approach was deemed scientifically reasonable and objective.<br>
										On the other hand, qualitative approaches focused on exploring ideas and formulating a theory or presumption, the examination is mainly expressed in words and the findings are analysed by summarizing, categorizing, and interpreting. Qualitative research has taken a naturalistic, interpretive approach that seeks to understand, examining objects in their natural contexts and attempting to explain and clarify situations in terms of the meanings people give them.<br><br>

										<b>Risk assessment Frameworks</b><br>
										During the research of the frameworks, found that the combination of Open FAIR and NIST CSF models could be quite effective (Cody, 2022).<br>
										The purpose of the NIST CSF is to establish uniform taxonomy and technique for businesses to characterize their existing and desired cybersecurity conditions. Identify and prioritize areas for improvement, evaluate progress toward the goal state, and communicate cybersecurity risk to internal and external stakeholders.<br>
										Following the knowledge of the broad areas of weakness, Open FAIR threat modelling could quantify the risk analysis, resulting in more objectively defensible findings. Improve your understanding of the threat simulated system's risk so it can make a more impartial comparison with other options (The Open Group, N.D.).<br><br>

										<b>Collaboration</b><br>
										By examining the target site, give us a testing platform to perform case practice on penetration tests. There are sufficient recommendations and methods provided in the suggested articles.<br>
										During my penetration test with Kali Linux, WAF blocked my IP addresses more than 20 times. Even I tried to use the proxy server and WAF bypass module, the false results were returned. I got the confident result until I set up the same version testing environment with the source code from Github (Matthew, 2018). It proved that the result could be more accurate if the system can be scanned locally, having internal testing which could simulate the attack by a malicious insider (Imperva, N.D.). It reflects the urgency when the zero-day vulnerability disclosed since the attacker are well tested on that impacted system. Nessus could be one of the quickest software to detect the vulnerability in the internal network by installing the new plugin, such as the Apache Log4j vulnerability that happened last year (Tenable, 2022).<br><br>

										<b>Collaboration</b><br>
										I am grateful to be a part of a group that makes several contributions and has the same goal of producing high-quality work. Assignments were subdivided and assigned appropriately, leading to the quality output and completion of all tasks on time. We would not hesitate to contribute our ideas and knowledge during our conversation. I have exhibited the risk assessment report, system design architecture, and disaster recovery plan from my job experience therefore we can all learn from each other.<br>
										We have opportunity to learn by engaging in the learning discussion peer response, which led me to investigate in-depth and critical thinking about the themes.<br><br>
